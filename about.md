I'm **Marcelo Borges**, a technology leader focused on **Data, AI, and modern cloud architectures** across Latin America. My passion is helping companies unlock the full potential of their data through real-world applications of:

- Distributed cloud databases  
- GenAI and agentic frameworks  
- High-scale transactional and analytical workloads  
- Practical, customer-driven design  

I bridge the technical and the business worlds — working with engineering teams, architects, C-level stakeholders, and partners to design systems that are **resilient, scalable, and AI-ready**.

My work spans the entire lifecycle of enterprise adoption: evaluation, PoCs, migration, architecture design, renewals, and long-term expansion. I enjoy creating clarity, communicating simply, and building trusted relationships.
