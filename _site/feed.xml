<p>There is no excuses to learn a new language today. The amount of resources, applications available to us is just mind bogling. All you need is some desire and dedication. In this blog I’ll share some of the things I’m doing.</p>

<p>In my case, Spanish is the language I chose. There are several reasons why. My mom was from Valencia, Spain, though she migrated with my grandparents to Brazil when she was 4 years old. We didn’t speak Spanish at home and the most I practice was trying to understand my Yayo (grandparent). Second, I’m Brazilian and the language a deceiving similar. Finally, I’m now working with latin america and it is just no right to communicate in the native languag of your clients.</p>

<p>TODO: write about how the portugues is deceiving similar to Spanish
TODO: write about youtube channels, soap operas/tv shows and podcast</p>

<p>After several starts and stops, I finally decided to learn.</p>

<p><strong>Duolingo</strong> is my primary form of learning Spanish.</p>]]></content><author><name>Marcelo Borges</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to the BorgesCloud Blog</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/12/02/welcome-to-borgescloud-blog.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to the BorgesCloud Blog" /><published>2025-12-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-12-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/12/02/welcome-to-borgescloud-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/12/02/welcome-to-borgescloud-blog.html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my first post on the BorgesCloud blog.</p>
